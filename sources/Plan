TO DO:

X 1. Make a very simple app with Godot wich only shows a label and export it
X      -make a Label node to show the digits 
X        -adjust font and size
X      -put a background image
X      -maybe do a while loop to increment numbers/change label
X      -find out how to export to .apk - configure it
X      -download it on your phone and test
X 2. Make a simple app with GoDot which only shows the tilt degree of the device.
X      -figure out how to get data from the phone's sensors
         http://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_input.html
X 3. Find out how to run a custom application on your phone, not from the store
 
 To implement the functionality of the ball (or whatever it edns up being), 
 there must be something like power bar to hold the value of the power for the 
 ball. If the ball misses its necessary power ups, the power quickly drops and 
 eventually it is lost, and the game is over. It will start with some value, 
 and then it will start going down. 
 
 4. Add a sprite and learn how to control it with gyroscope
      -try to make the object go up, instead of fall
      -see how to control the speed/power it goes up to - maybe increase gravity
       to slow it down?
 5. Make the sprite jump/move all the time
      -find out how to make endless game
 6. Make the sprite bounce off the edges of the scene
      -use angles to figure out new directions
 7. Think of name
 8. Think of a theme/character
 9. Make an icon
 
 You need to figure out how to implement the tilting into an input for
 a given sprite/character.
 You need to find out how to configure the collision polygon. 
 Interact with the user.

 Add credits for fonts, pictures, info souces etc.
